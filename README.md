# Konnectors

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cozy-labs/konnectors.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cozy-labs/konnectors)

Collection of connectors to fetch data from different websites and save them
into your Cozy.

If you want to build your own connector, here is [a complete documentation](https://github.com/cozy-labs/konnectors/wiki)

# Contributing rules

Before opening any pull requests make sure that you follow these rules:

* Make your pull requests on the master branch.
* Follow the [Cozy Guidelines](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-guidelines).
* Make sure that `npm run lint` doesn't return any errors.
* Do not include the build in your pull request.
* For konnector addition, make sure that the following locale keys are present:
 * 'konnector description my_connector_name': explains what the connector does
 * Notification texts: if your connector pops up notifications on completed fetch,
   it requires a localized text (use any of the existing docTypes notification or create your own key).
* You have updated the connector list (if relevant)
* Explain in the Pull Request which problem is solved and how you fixed it (plateform changes).
